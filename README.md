# Principles

We practice Software Engineering and Computing Science under the following
principles.

### Good Software is Humble.
It does not attempt to be more than what it actually is. It does not attempt to
do less or more than what it says it will do. It shows its defects and flaws in
obvious ways.

### Good Software is Sustainable.
It is not built to be discarded, it is built to scale with the users needs, it
is built to be maintained, and it is built to be composable with other software.

### Good Software is Purposeful.
It addresses a specific concern, concrete or abstract, to the benefit of the
users. It serves a particular purpose, thoroughly, and it does not have
accidental effects.

### Good Software is Principled.
It is grounded in mathematical, logical, and scientific foundations. It is
consistent with itself and itâ€™s surroundings. It is tractable, and it is
provable. It is not accidental, and it's patterns go beyond language and
culture.

### Good Software is Elegant
It gives aesthetic pleasure, it communicates insights into its purpose and into
the problem it solves

### Good Software is Frugal.
It utilizes the minimum resources necessary to describe solutions and execute
them.
